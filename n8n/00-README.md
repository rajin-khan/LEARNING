## 📚 What You'll Learn

This comprehensive guide will teach you everything you need to know about **n8n**, an open-source workflow automation tool that enables you to connect various applications and services to automate tasks without extensive coding. You'll learn how to:

- Set up and install n8n (both cloud and self-hosted)
- Create your first automated workflows
- Understand core concepts like nodes, expressions, and data flow
- Build complex automations with conditional logic
- Handle errors and troubleshoot common issues
- Optimize workflows for performance
- Integrate with popular services (Gmail, Slack, databases, APIs)
- Use advanced features like AI integration and custom nodes

## 🎯 Prerequisites

Before diving into n8n, you should have:

- **Basic understanding of APIs**: Know what REST APIs are and how they work
- **JSON familiarity**: Understanding of JSON data format (key-value pairs, arrays, objects)
- **Command line basics**: Comfortable with terminal/command prompt (for self-hosting)
- **Docker knowledge** (optional): Helpful if you plan to self-host n8n
- **Web concepts**: Basic understanding of HTTP requests, webhooks, and URLs

> [!TIP]
> **Don't worry if you're missing some prerequisites!** n8n is designed to be accessible to both technical and non-technical users. The fundamentals guide (02-fundamentals.md) will cover the essential concepts you need.

- **Visual interface**: Build automations using a drag-and-drop editor (no coding required)
- **Self-host**: Run on your own infrastructure for full data control
- **Extensible**: Create custom nodes and workflows

Think of it as a visual programming language for automation, similar to Zapier or Make, but open-source and self-hostable.

## 🎯 Use Cases

Common scenarios where n8n shines:

- **Email automation**: Auto-respond, categorize, or forward emails
- **Data synchronization**: Keep databases, spreadsheets, and apps in sync
- **Notification systems**: Send alerts when events occur
- **Content workflows**: Automate publishing, formatting, and distribution
- **API integrations**: Connect services that don't have native integrations
- **AI workflows**: Build AI agents and automate AI-powered tasks
- **E-commerce**: Process orders, update inventory, send confirmations
